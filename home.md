# napari Workshops: Learn to Visualize, Analyze, and Extend

Welcome to the napari workshops! This comprehensive workshop series takes you from napari beginner to plugin developer through three progressive, hands-on workshops. Whether you want to use napari for interactive image analysis, build custom analysis tools, or create plugins to share with the scientific community, these workshops will get you there.

## Workshop Series Overview

### Workshop 1: Introduction to napari (Beginner, 3-4 hours)

[View Workshop 1](#intro-napari)

Learn to use napari's graphical interface for bioimage visualization, manual annotation, and interactive analysis. This workshop is perfect for scientists who want to leverage napari's powerful visualization capabilities without writing code.

**You'll learn to:**

- Navigate the napari viewer and work with multi-dimensional images
- Use different layer types (Image, Points, Shapes, Labels)
- Perform manual annotation and interactive analysis
- Install and use community plugins

**Perfect for:** Microscopists, biologists, and image analysts new to napari

### Workshop 2: Extending napari with Scripts (Intermediate, 3-4 hours)

[View Workshop 2](#extend-napari)

Bridge the gap between GUI usage and development by learning to extend napari through scripting. You'll create interactive widgets, respond to events, and build reproducible analysis workflows that combine napari with the scientific Python ecosystem.

**You'll learn to:**

- Control napari programmatically from Python
- Create interactive widgets using magicgui
- Implement custom mouse callbacks and event handlers
- Build reproducible analysis workflows

**Perfect for:** Python users who want to customize napari for their specific analysis needs

### Workshop 3: Developing napari Plugins (Advanced but accessible, 4-5 hours)

[View Workshop 3](#develop-napari-plugins)

Package your custom functionality as installable plugins to share with collaborators or the broader napari community. Learn about plugin architecture, testing, publishing, and maintenance.

**You'll learn to:**

- Structure napari plugins using npe2
- Implement different plugin contribution types
- Test and debug plugins
- Publish to PyPI and the napari hub
- Maintain plugins over time

**Perfect for:** Developers who want to share tools with the scientific community

## Getting Started

### Choose Your Path

**Never used napari?** Start with {ref}`intro-napari`

**Comfortable with napari GUI but want to customize it?** Jump to {ref}`extend-napari`

**Ready to build and share plugins?** Go to {ref}`develop-napari-plugins`

### Installation

Use the {ref}`installation` guide to prepare your environment and install napari and its required dependencies locally. Running napari locally is likely to give you the best experience, but you can also run napari and the workshop materials in the cloud. See our {ref}`cloud setup instructions <cloud-setup>` for details.

## Workshop Philosophy

These workshops are designed to be:

- **Hands-on:** Learn by doing with real data and analysis scenarios
- **Progressive:** Each workshop builds on previous knowledge
- **Standalone:** Each workshop can be understood independently with appropriate prerequisites
- **Practical:** Focus on skills you'll use in your research
