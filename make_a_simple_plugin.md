# Creating a napari plugin

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will make a napari analysis plugin from the
`detect_spots()` function we wrote in the first part of this practical session.
The primary steps in making a napari plugin are as follows:

1. Choose which manifest contribution(s) your plugin requires
2. Create your repository using the [napari-plugin-template](https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template)
3. Implement your contributions
4. Share your plugin with the community

In the following sections, we will work through steps (1) - (3).
To set up a minimal plugin, you can read the ["Your first plugin"](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/building_a_plugin/first_plugin.html#your-first-plugin) tutorial on napari.org.
A functional napari plugin only needs 4 files to be shared with the community,
but you will find many other helpful files in the template that make plugins
easier to develop and maintain.
For step (4), you can refer to the [in depth plugin tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL-VywidzXE),
or [the deploy instructions on napari.org](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/building_a_plugin/index.html#[plugin-test-deploy]).

## Choosing a contribution

A contribution is a construct in `napari.yaml` (the manifest file), that napari
uses for each specific type of plugin. Each contribution conforms to a function
signature, i.e. the function linked to the contribution defines what napari
provides to the plugin (e.g., data and parameters) and what the plugin returns
to napari. napari is then able to use the functions pointed to in `napari.yaml`
to carry out the plugin tasks. Please see the
[contributions guide](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/building_a_plugin/guides.html) for more details.
(And technical references for the
[manifest](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/technical_references/manifest.html) and
[contributions](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/technical_references/contributions.html).
Many plugins will declare multiple contributions to provide all of the desired
functionality.

The current categories of contributions are described below:

- **reader**: allows loading of specified data formats into napari layers;
- **writer**: this allows layer data to be written to disk in specified formats;
- **sample data**: allows developers to provide users with sample data with
  their plugin;
- **widget**: allows custom Qt widgets (GUIs) to be added to napari, either from
  a `magic_factory` widget, a plain function, or a subclass of QWidget;
- **theme**: allows customization of the entire napari viewer appearance e.g.
  light theme or dark theme.

In this tutorial, we will create a spot detection plugin by implementing a
widget contribution with the spot detection function (`detect_spots()`) we
created in the first part of this practical session.

## Using the copier `napari-plugin-template` to create your plugin repository

To make creating the creating plugins easier, we provide a template that
automatically builds most of the infrastructure for your plugin, so you can
focus on implementing the details unique to your plugin. The template is
implemented using a command line utility called
[`copier`](https://github.com/copier-org/copier).
In the following steps, you will build your plugin directory using the
[`napari-plugin-template`](https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template) template.

First, open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want the plugin
folder to be created. As before, we recommend using your Documents folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

Next, activate the conda environment you created in the first part of the
tutorial and install the necessary packages to run the template.

```bash
conda activate napari-workshop
conda install copier jinja2-time npe2
```

In this next step, we will use `copier` to create a directory for our
plugin from the template. The template will ask a series of questions that
will customize the directory for your plugin. Once completed, a new directory
will be created in your current directory. It will come pre-initialized with a
git repository. Replace \<new-plugin-name> with the name you would like to
call your plugin.

```bash
copier copy --trust https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template <new-plugin-name>
```

Alternatively, you can use a single command to start the template with `uv`:

```bash
uv tool run --with jinja2-time --with npe2 copier copy --trust https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template <new-plugin-name>
```

You will be asked for some information to customize the setup of your plugin.
Each prompt gives the default value in square brackets (`[]`). Enter your answer
after the prompt and press enter to continue. When prompted for which plugins
to include, you only need to answer `Yes` to `Include widget plugin?`,
but you may be interested in exploring the other contributions as well.

To read more about the prompts, you can refer to the `napari-plugin-template`
[Prompts Reference](https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template/blob/main/PROMPTS.md)
After completing all of the questions, a directory will be created containing
your new napari plugin. You will be given instructions on how to upload the
initialized git repository to GitHub. By default, we will not be covering this
aspect in the tutorial, but please feel free to ask the teaching team if you
would like to give it a try. Your new plugin directory (assuming you called the
plugin `napari-spot-detector` and the module `napari_spot_detector`) will be
organized as follows.

```text

See below for explanations about some of the most notable files, but do not
hesitate to reach out to the teaching team if you have questions about any of
the other files.

- `.github/workflows/test_and_deploy.yml`: This is a
  [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that will
  automatically run the tests and upload your plugin to pypi (thus making it
  available through the built-in napari plugin browser. Please ask the teaching
  team if you would like to learn how to set up your github repository to
  support this workflow.
- `pyproject.toml`: This file allows your plugin to be built as
  a package and installed by pip. The `napari-plugin-template` has set everything
  up in these files, so you are good to go!
- The `src/` folder contains all the Python code for your plugin.
- `src/napari_spot_detector/_widget.py`: This file contains example
  implementations for different widget contributions. This is where you will add
  your `detect_spot()` function. 
- The `src/napari_spot_detector/napari.yaml` file declares commands and
  contributions for each example widget in the `_widget.py` file. Look at these
  carefully and match up which command & contribution belong to what Python code
  in the `_widget.py` file.

You have now set up the directory for your new plugin! You can explore the
directory and files with the file browser. In the next step, you will complete
your plugin by adding your `detect_spots()` function to the `_widget.py` file.

## Implementing a widget contribution

In this step, we will implement our `detect_spots()` function as a plugin
contribution. First, we will add our spot detection function to the plugin
package. Then, we will add the type annotations to the function so that
napari can infer the correct GUI elements to add to our plugin.

1. To edit your plugin source code, open an integrated development environment
   (VSCode is a good, free option) or text editor.
2. In VSCode, open the directory you created with `copier` in the section
   above.
     - From the "File" menu, select "Open..."
     - Navigate to and select the directory you created with `copier`
     (`~/Documents/napari-spot-detector` if you called your plugin
     `napari-spot-detector)`.
3. You should now see your plugin directory in the "Explorer" pane in the left
   hand side of the window. You can double click on folders to expand them and
   files to open them in the editor.
4. Open the `src/<module_name>/_widget.py` file using VSCode by double clicking on
   it in the "Explorer" pane.
5. You will see that it has already been populated with a few code blocks by
   the template.
     - At the top, you see the imports. You can leave unchanged for now.

     - Next, you see four different ways to add widgets to napari.

        1. The first is a pure Python function flagged with `autogenerate: true`
           in the plugin manifest. Type annotations are used by magicgui to
           generate widgets for each parameter. This is best suited for simple
           processing tasks - usually taking in and/or returning a layer.

        2. The second option is a `magic_factory` decorated function. The
           `magic_factory` decorator allows you to customize aspects of the
           resulting GUI, including the widgets associated with each parameter.
           This is best used when you have a very simple processing task, but
           want some control over the autogenerated widgets.

        3. The third option is a `magicgui.widgets.Container` subclass. This
           provides lots of flexibility and customization options while still
           supporting `magicgui` widgets and convenience methods for creating
           widgets from type annotations. If you want to easily customize your widgets
           and connect callbacks, this is the best widget option for you.

        4. The fourth option subclasses `QWidget` directly. This provides maximal
           flexibility but requires full specification of widget layouts,
           callbacks, events, etc.

     - For this tutorial, we'll focus on the first approach (the autogenerate
       function) since it's the simplest and most suitable for our spot
       detection function. This means our function doesn't need to know anything about magicgui. If
       we provide type annotations to the parameters, the GUI widgets will be
       generated for us without even a decorator!
     - Find the `Command` ID in `napari.yaml` that points to
       `threshold_autogenerate_widget`, and then find that `Command` ID in the
       `Widgets` contribution section. Note that unlike the other `widget`
       contributions, this one includes `autogenerate: true`.

         ```yaml
         - command: napari-spot-detector.make_func_widget
           autogenerate: true
           display_name: Example Function Widget
         ```

     - Let's edit `threshold_autogenerate_widget` to do our spot detection.

6. You can keep all the example functions in `_widget.py` for reference, or you
   can delete the ones you don't need. If you delete any functions, make sure
   to also delete the associated `Commands` and `Widget` contributions from
   `napari.yaml`, and update the imports in `napari_spot_detector/__init__.py`!
7. Copy the `gaussian_high_pass()` and `detect_spots()` functions from your
   notebook from the first part of the tutorial and add them to the file.
8. Next, we need to modify `detect_spots()` to work as a napari widget. You can
   either modify the existing `threshold_autogenerate_widget` function or create
   a new function. The function should return the necessary layer data so that
   napari can create a new `Points` layer with our detected spots. If
   `detect_spots()` returns a `LayerDataTuple`, napari will add a new layer to
   the viewer using the data in the [`LayerDataTuple`](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/extending/magicgui.html#returning-napari-types-layerdatatuple).
    - The layer data tuple should be: `(layer_data, layer_metadata, layer_type)`
    - `layer_data`: the data to be displayed in the new layer (i.e., the points
      coordinates)
    - `layer_metadata`: the display options for the layer stored as a
      dictionary. Some options to consider: `symbol`, `size`
    - `layer_type`: the name of the layer type as a string (i.e., `'Points'`)
9. Add type annotations to the function parameters (inputs). napari (via
   [magicgui](https://pyapp-kit.github.io/magicgui/)) will infer the required GUI
   elements from the type annotations. We have to add annotations to both the
   parameters (i.e., inputs to the function) and the return type.
10. Annotate the Return type as `"napari.types.LayerDataTuple"`.
11. Add the required imports for the `scipy.ndimage` module and `scikit-image`
   `blob_log()` function to the top of the file.
    - `from scipy import ndimage as ndi`
    - `from skimage.feature import blob_log`
12. Finally, we need to add the function to the [`napari.yaml`](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/building_a_plugin/first_plugin.html#add-a-napari-yaml-manifest)
    file so that napari can find the declarations of the plugin without having to import every module
    at startup. You can read more about how to properly declare a widget in the
    [Contributions Reference](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/technical_references/contributions.html#contributions-widgets).
    In addition, we can declare plugin contributions to [napari menus](https://napari.org/dev/naps/6-contributable-menus.html#plugin-submenus)
    so that users can find your contributions according to intended use.

## Explore the other files generated by napari-plugin-template

In order for napari to automatically find and make your plugin available to the
user once it has been installed (i.e., "discoverable"), we must add a
`napari.manifest` entry point to the `pyproject.toml` file. An entry point is a way
that a Python package can advertise that it has a component available (our
plugin in this case). napari searches the python environment for packages that
have a `napari.manifest` and then uses the path in the `entry_point` to find
`napari.yaml`, where all your plugin functionality is declared.

If we open the `pyproject.toml` file created by the template, we see that the entry
point was already added by the template! If you called your plugin
`napari-spot-detector` and your module `napari_spot_detector`, you will see the
following:

```yaml
[project.entry-points."napari.manifest"]
napari.manifest =
    napari-spot-detector = "napari_spot_detector:napari.yaml"
```

Note that `src` doesn't occur in the path to `napari.yaml`, but `napari.yaml` is
definitely within the `src` folder! Python knows to look inside the `src` folder
for your code because `pyproject.toml` declares so with the following:

```yaml
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
```

## Installing and trying out your plugin

To use our plugin, we need to install it in our Python environment.
First, return to your terminal and verify you have the `napari-workshop`
environment activated. Then, navigate to the directory that you created with the
template. For example, if you named your plugin `napari-spot-detector`, you
would enter the following into your terminal.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/napari-spot-detector
```

Then, we install the plugin with pip. pip is the package installer for Python
(see [the documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for more information).
We will use the `-e` option to install in "editable" mode. This means that when
we make a change to our source code, it will update the installed package the
next time it is imported, without us having to reinstall it.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To confirm if your installation completed successfully, you can launch napari
from the command line.

```bash
napari
```

Once napari is open, you can open your plugin from the "Plugin" menu. You can
test your plugin by locating the spots image from the tutorial notebooks folder
we downloaded at the beginning of this tutorial in the File browser
(`<path to notebook folder>/data/stardist_masks.tif`), dragging the image into
the napari viewer, and try running the plugin.

Congratulations! You have made your first napari plugin!

## Bonus exercises

In case you have finished all of the exercises with some time to spare, we have
provided some ideas for ways that you can extend the plugin. Please feel free to
give them a go and ask the teaching team if you have any questions.

- Add sample data to your plugin. To do so, you would need to implement the
  [sample data contribution](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/building_a_plugin/guides.html#sample-data)
- Add an option to your `detect_spots()` function plugin to return the filtered
  image in addition to the points layer.
- Add some tests to the `_tests/test_widget.py` file.
- Upload your plugin to github
- Start your own plugin
- Consult with the teaching team about integrating napari into your workflow
